# PlanetarySystemGenerator

Old side project designed as a proof of concept for generating large amounts of data for use in table top campaigns and science fiction media. My initial foray into OOP javaScript.

Just HTML, CSS (SCSS pre-processor) and javaScript. Can be reletively slow if generating a lot of systems due to the amount of HTML being generated.
